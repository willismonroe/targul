This repository serves as a testing bed for tools useful for digital Assyriology.  When things get to a good state, I'm trying to merge them into the {Classical Language Toolkit](https://github.com/cltk/cltk).

There is currently a [bug](https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/PY-22819) in Pycharm which is making some debugging of the tools difficult.
